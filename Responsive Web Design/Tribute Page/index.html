            Zeno was born c. 334 BCE, in Citium in Cyprus. His ancestry is
            disputed between Phoenician and Greek, because Citium contained both
            Phoenician and Greek inhabitants. Zeno is described as a haggard,
            dark-skinned person, living a spare, ascetic life despite his
            wealth. Zeno began teaching in the colonnade in the Agora of Athens
            known as the Stoa Poikile in 301 BC. His disciples were initially
            called "Zenonians," but eventually they came to be known as
            "Stoics," a name previously applied to poets who congregated in the
            Stoa Poikile. Zeno died around 262 BCE.

            <h3 class="sub-topic">Logic</h3>
            <p class="sub-info">
              In his treatment of logic, Zeno was influenced by Stilpo and the
              other Megarians. Zeno urged the need to lay down a basis for logic
              because the wise person must know how to avoid deception. Zeno
              divided true conceptions into the comprehensible and the
              incomprehensible, permitting for free-will the power of assent in
              distinguishing between sense impressions.

            <h3 class="sub-topic">Physics</h3>
            <p class="sub-info">
              The universe, in Zeno's view, is God: a divine reasoning entity,
              where all the parts belong to the whole. Into this pantheistic
              system he incorporated the physics of Heraclitus; the universe
              contains a divine artisan-fire, which foresees everything, and
              extending throughout the universe, must produce everything.<br />
              This divine fire, or aether, is the basis for all activity in the
              universe, operating on otherwise passive matter, which neither
              increases nor diminishes itself. The primary substance in the
              universe comes from fire, passes through the stage of air, and
              then becomes water: the thicker portion becoming earth, and the
              thinner portion becoming air again, and then rarefying back into
              fire. Individual souls are part of the same fire as the world-soul
              of the universe. Following Heraclitus, Zeno adopted the view that
              the universe underwent regular cycles of formation and
              destruction.

            <h3 class="sub-topic">Ethics</h3>
            <p class="sub-info">
              Zeno recognized a single, sole and simple good, which is the only
              goal to strive for. "Happiness is a good flow of life," said Zeno,
              and this can only be achieved through the use of right reason
              coinciding with the universal reason, which governs everything. A
              bad feeling "is a disturbance of the mind repugnant to reason, and
              against Nature". This consistency of soul, out of which morally
              good actions spring, is virtue, true good can only consist in
              virtue. <br />
              Zeno deviated from the Cynics in saying that things that are
              morally adiaphora (indifferent) could nevertheless have value.
              Things have a relative value in proportion to how they aid the
              natural instinct for self-preservation. That which is to be
              preferred is a "fitting action", a designation Zeno first
              introduced. Self-preservation, and the things that contribute
              towards it, has only a conditional value; it does not aid
              happiness, which depends only on moral actions.
